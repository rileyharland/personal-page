		<h3>About Me</h3>
		<p>I recently relocated from Australia and I am currently looking to join a great team in the Toronto startup community. In the last 12 months I have graduated law school and collaborated to launch and develop a corporate team building and leadership development business.</p>
		<p>I have lived, worked, and traveled in over 20 countries across 6 continents, and this has taught me to treat every challenge as an opportunity for growth. I have always had a strong interest in start-ups, entrepreneurship, and technology. </p>
		<p>I am passionate about building strong relationships with people and always seek opportunities for self-development and growth. I am currently in the process of learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript at Bitmaker Labs.</p>
		<p>I want to build a career in Toronto and I am eager to join a team of amazing people who I can help achieve great things. I believe that a strong culture is the backbone of a great team and I always push myself to get the best results â€“ through continual learning, maximum effort, and a drive to be the best I can be.</p>
		<p>I would love to chat about what I can bring to your team.</p>
